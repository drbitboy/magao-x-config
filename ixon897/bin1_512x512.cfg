# CAMERA_MODEL 	"Generic 16 bit monochrome Camera Link"
#
# This is a generic camera configuration file, intended as a starting 
# place for creating a file for a Camera Link camera, connected to an
# EDT Camera Link Framegrabber board. (For AIA [LVDS and RS-422] cameras
# and boards, see generic8.cfg, generic10.cfg, generic12.cfg, etc.)
#
# Unmodified, this file should work for a single-tap Camera-Link
# camera that outputs data continuously (no trigger required) in
# 1024x1024, 16-bits per pixel with the LSB on VD0 or MSB0.  The image
# capture library will produce a buffer with 16-bit monochrome data,
# pixels left-justified in a 2-byte word.
#
# For detailed information on the configuration directives initialization 
# procedures, see the camera Configuration Guide and the PCI DV User's guide, 
# on your installation disk and in the documentation section of our web
# site (www.edt.com).
#
# EDT cls (simulator board) and channel 2 simulator generated data checksums,
# for validation tests (internal)

# rbtfile specifies the FPGA file to be loaded (almost always aiag.bit), for
# boards that have a separate UI FPGA.  Newer boards (PCIe, Camera Link)
# employ a single combined PCIe/UI FPGA; this directive will be ignored in
# those cases. Nevertheless, an rbtfile should be specified in case the config
# ever gets used with a board that needs it.

rbtfile: aiagcl.bit

# camera link data path register bits (argument is a 2-digit hex value):
# sets the expected input data size and #taps
# bits 0-3: number of bits per pixel minus 1
# bits 4-7: number of taps minus 1

CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             0f	# single tap

# camera link config register bits
# (arg is a 2-digit hex value, hexval shown in parens):
# 0 (01): RGB (set for RGB (except bayer). Applies to older/PCI, ignored on newer/PCIe)
# 1 (02): ignore data valid (on for most cameras though not all)
# 2 (04): generate an FVAL on every LVAL or vactv lines if bit 4 is set, for line scan cameras
# 3 (08): disable ROI (rarely set)
# 4 (10): generate an FVAL after every vactv lines if bit 2 is also set, for line scan cameras
# 5 (20): data valid invert (rare)
# 6 (40): RGB swap -- swap red/blue
# 7 (80): enable roi pad: if ROI > img output, will pad missing bytes
